Code to estimate performance of underactuated partially soft robotic gripper with controllable-stiffness joints.
Joint movements based on framework suggested by Rocchi, Ames, Li, and Hauser in the ICRA 2016 submission "Stable Simulation of 
Underactuated Compliant Hands"
Due to the inclusion of soft robotic components, the system was more complex than the one modelled in the original paper, so the 
linearized transmission and stiffness matrices had to be used and the equations rearranged.
The derivation of this and system identification process will be documenting in an upcoming paper in the Soft Robotics Journal, planned to 
be tited "Contact Force and Synergy Matrix Estimation of Soft Robotic Hands"
